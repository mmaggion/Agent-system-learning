\section{Preliminaries}\label{meanfield}

In the Appendix we recall some of the basic notions related to optimal transport and Wasserstein distances that are relevant in this work.
Here we only recall the following definition for the Wasserstein-$1$ distance:

\subsection{Optimal transport and Wasserstein distances}

The space $\mathcal{P}(\R^n)$ is the set of probability measures on $\R^n$, while the space %\footnote{We follow the notation of \cite{AGS}.} 
$\mathcal{P}_1(\R^n)$ is the subset of $\mathcal{P}(\R^n)$ whose elements $\mu$ have finite $1$-st moment, i.e.,
$\int_{\R^n} |x| d\mu(x) < +\infty$.
We denote by $\mathcal{P}_c(\R^n)$ the subset of $\mathcal{P}_p(\R^n)$ which consists of all probability measures with compact support. %Notice that, if $(\mu_{\ell})_{\ell \in \N}$ is a sequence in $\mathcal{P}_c(\R^n)$ and it exists $R>0$ such that $\supp(\mu_{\ell}) \subseteq B(0, R)$ for all $\ell\in\N$, then $(\mu_{\ell})_{\ell \in \N}$ is compact in $\mathcal{P}_p(\R^n)$ for all $p \geq 1$.
%For any $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\R^{n_1})$ and  a Borel function $f: \R^{n_1} \to \R^{n_2}$, we denote by $f_{\#}\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\R^{n_2})$ the {\it push-forward of $\mu$ through $f$}, defined by
%\begin{align*}
%f_{\#}\mu(B) := \mu(f^{-1}(B)) \quad \text{ for every Borel set } B \text{ of } \R^{n_2}.
%\end{align*}
%In particular, if one considers the projection operators $p_1$ and $p_2$ defined on the product space $\R^{n_1} \times \R^{n_2}$, for every $\pi \in \mathcal{P}(\R^{n_1} \times \R^{n_2})$ we call {\it first} (resp., {\it second}) {\it marginal} of $\pi$ the probability measure $p_{1\#}\pi$ (respectively, $p_{2\#}\pi$). Given $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(\R^{n_1})$ and $\nu \in \mathcal{P}(\R^{n_2})$, we denote with $\Gamma(\mu, \nu)$ the family of couplings between $\mu$ and $\nu$, i.e. the subset of all probability measures in $\mathcal{P}(\R^{n_1} \times \R^{n_2})$ with first marginal $\mu$ and second marginal $\nu$.
%
%On the set $\mathcal{P}_p(\R^n)$ we shall consider the following distance, called the Wasserstein or Monge-Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance,
%\begin{align}  \label{e_Wp}
%\W^p_p(\mu,\nu)=\inf_{\pi \in \Gamma(\mu,\nu)} \int_{\R^{2n}} |x-y|^p d \pi(x,y)\,.
%\end{align}
The $1$-Monge-Kantorovich-Rubinstein-Wasserstein distance \cite{\cite{AGS,villani}} between $\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}_1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ may be defined as
\begin{align}\label{dualwass}
\W_1(\mu,\nu)=\sup \left \{ \int_{\R^n} \varphi(x) d (\mu-\nu)(x)  : \varphi \in \Lip(\R^n), \; \Lip_{\R^n}(\varphi) \leq 1 \right \},
\end{align}
where $\Lip_{\R^n}(\varphi)$ stands for the Lipschitz constant of $\varphi$ on $\R^n$. 
%We denote by $\Gamma_o(\mu,\nu)$ the set of optimal couplings for which the minimum is attained, i.e.,
%\begin{align*}
%\pi \in \Gamma_o(\mu, \nu) \iff \pi \in \Gamma(\mu, \nu) \text{ and } \int_{\R^{2n}} | x - y |^p d \pi(x,y) = \W^p_p(\mu,\nu).
%\end{align*}
%It is well-known that $\Gamma_o(\mu, \nu)$ is non-empty for every $(\mu,\nu) \in \mathcal{P}_p(\R^n)\times\mathcal{P}_p(\R^n)$. For more details, see e.g. \cite{AGS,villani}.

For any $\mu \in \PP(\R^d)$ and $f: \R^d \to \R^d$, the convolution of $f$ and $\mu$ is
\begin{align*}
(f * \mu)(x) = \int_{\R^d} f(x-y) d\mu(y)\,.
\end{align*}
This function is continuous whenever $f$ is continuous and satisfies $| f(x) | \leq C (1 + |x|)$ for all $\xi \in \R^d$, and some constant $C$.

\subsection{The mean-field limit equation and existence of solutions}

As already stated in the introduction, our learning approach is based on the following underlying \textit{finite time horizon initial value problem}: given $T > 0$ and $\mu_0 \in \PC(\R^d)$, consider a probability measure-valued trajectory $\mu:[0,T]\rightarrow \PP(\R^d)$ satisfying 
\begin{align}\label{eq:contdyn}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial t}(t) &= -\nabla \cdot ((\Fun{a}*\mu(t))\mu(t)) \quad \text{ for } t \in (0,T],\\
\mu(0) &=\mu_0.
\end{aligned}\right.
\end{align}
%We consequently give our notion of solution for \eqref{eq:contdyn}.
%\begin{definition}
%We say that a map $\mu:[0,T]\rightarrow\PP(\R^d)$ is a solution of \eqref{eq:contdyn} with initial datum $\mu_0$ if the following hold:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item $\mu$ has uniformly compact support, i.e., there exists $R > 0$ such that $\supp(\mu(t)) \subset B(0,R)$ for every $t \in [0,T]$;
%\item $\mu$ is continuous with respect to the Wasserstein distance $\W_1$;
%\item $\mu$ satisfies \eqref{eq:contdyn} in the weak sense, i.e., for every $\phi \in \mathcal{C}^{\infty}_c(\R^d;\R)$ it holds
%\begin{align*}
%\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\R^d} \phi(x) d\mu(t)(x) = \int_{\R^d} \nabla \phi(x) \cdot (\Fun{a}*\mu(t))(x) d\mu(t)(x).
%\end{align*}
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

The equation \eqref{eq:contdyn} is closely related to the family of ODEs, indexed by $N \in \N$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:discrdyn}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}^N_i(t) &= \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{j = 1}\Fun{a}(x^N_i(t) - x^N_j(t)) \quad \text{ for } t \in (0,T],\\
x_i^N(0) &= x^N_{0,i},
\end{aligned} \quad i = 1, \ldots, N, \right.
\end{align}
which may be rewritten as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:discr1}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}^N_i(t) &= (\Fun{a}*\mu^N(t))(x^N_i(t)) \\
x^N_i(0) &= x^N_{0,i},
\end{aligned} \quad i = 1, \ldots, N, \right.
\end{align}
for $t\in(0,T]$, by means of the \textit{empirical measure} $\mu^N:[0,T]\rightarrow\PC(\R^d)$ defined as
\begin{align}\label{eq:empmeas}
\mu^N(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{j = 1} \delta_ {x^N_j(t)}.
\end{align}
We shall restrict our attention to interaction kernels belonging to the following \textit{set of admissible kernels}
\begin{align*}
	X=\bigl\{b:\R_+\rightarrow\R\,|\ b \in L_{\infty}(\R_+) \cap W^{1}_{\infty,\loc}(\R_+) \bigr \}.
\end{align*}
The well-posedness of \eqref{eq:discr1} is rather standard under the assumption $a \in X$. The well-posedness of system \eqref{eq:contdyn} and several crucial properties enjoyed by its solutions may also be proved as soon as $a \in X$.
We refer the reader to \cite{AGS} for results on existence and uniqueness of solutions for \eqref{eq:contdyn}, and to  \cite{13-Carrillo-Choi-Hauray-MFL} for generalizations in case of interaction kernels not necessarily belonging to the class $X$. We recall some of results that will be useful in this work.

%The following result provides a strong link between solutions of system \eqref{eq:discrdyn} and those of system \eqref{eq:contdyn}, one that in the end enables us to state an existence result for the latter ones. 

\begin{proposition}\label{pr:exist}
Let $\mu_0 \in \PC(\R^d)$ be given. Let $(\mu^{N}_0)_{N \in \N} \subset \PC(\R^d)$ be a sequence of empirical measures of the form
\begin{align*}
\mu^{N}_0 = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i = 1} \delta_{x^{N}_{0,i}}, \quad \text{ for some } x^{N}_{0,i} \in \supp(\mu_0)
\end{align*}
satisfying $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \W_1(\mu_0,\mu^{N}_0) = 0$. For every $N \in \N$, denote with $\mu^N:[0,T] \rightarrow \PP(\R^{d})$ the curve given by \eqref{eq:empmeas} where $(x^N_1,\ldots,x^N_N)$ is the unique solution of system \eqref{eq:discrdyn}.

Then, there exists $R > 0$ depending only on $T,a$, and $\supp(\mu_0)$ such that the sequence $(\mu^N)_{N \in \N}$ converges, up to extraction of subsequences, in $\mathcal{P}_1(B(0,R))$ equipped with the Wasserstein metric $\W_1$ to a solution $\mu$ of \eqref{eq:contdyn} with initial datum $\mu_0$ satisfying
\begin{align*}
\supp(\mu^N(t)) \cup \supp(\mu(t)) \subseteq B(0,R), \quad \text{ for every } N \in \N \text{ and } t \in [0,T].
\end{align*}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{The transport map and  uniqueness of mean-field solutions}

Another way for building a solution of equation \eqref{eq:contdyn} is by means of the so-called \textit{transport map}, i.e., the function describing the evolution in time of the initial measure $\mu_0$. The transport map can be constructed by considering the single-agent version of system \eqref{eq:discr1}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:transpdyn}
\left\{\begin{aligned}
\dot{\xi}(t) &= (\Fun{a}*\mu(t))(\xi(t)) \quad \text{ for } t \in (0,T],\\
\xi(0) &= \xi_0,
\end{aligned}\right.
\end{align}
where $\xi$ is a mapping from $[0,T]$ to $\R^d$ and $a \in X$. Here $\mu:[0,T]\rightarrow\PP(\R^d)$ is a continuous map with respect to the Wasserstein distance $\W_1$ satisfying $\mu(0) = \mu_0$ and $\supp(\mu(t)) \subseteq B(0,R)$, for a given $R>0$.%where $R$ is given by \eqref{Rest} from the choice of $T$, $a$ and $\mu_0$. 

If $\mu$ is any solution of \eqref{eq:contdyn}, we can consider  the family of flow maps $\mathcal{T}^{\mu}_t:\R^d \rightarrow\R^d$, indexed by $t \in [0,T]$ and the mapping $\mu$, defined by
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{T}^{\mu}_t(\xi_0) = \xi(t),
\end{align*}
where $\xi:[0,T]\rightarrow\R^d$ is the unique solution of \eqref{eq:transpdyn} with initial datum $\xi_0$. A well-known result \cite[Theorem 3.10]{CanCarRos10} shows that the solution of \eqref{eq:contdyn} with initial value $\mu_0$ is also the unique fixed-point of the \textit{push-foward map}
\begin{align}\label{eq:fixedpoint}
\Gamma[\mu](t) := (\mathcal{T}^{\mu}_t)_{\#}\mu_0.
\end{align}

A relevant, basic property of the transport map is (see \cite{CanCarRos10})

\begin{proposition}\label{p-transportlip}
$\ct^\mu_t$ is a locally bi-Lipschitz map, i.e. it is a locally Lipschitz map, with locally Lipschitz inverse.
\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%%Bijectivity is a consequence of the uniqueness of the solution to the corresponding ODE.
%	
%	%In particular,we have
%	%\begin{align*}
%	%	|g(t,x)-g(t,y)|\leq C_{a,\mu}|x-y|
%	%\end{align*}
%	%for almost every $t$ and $x_1,x_2$ with $|x_i|\leq c_{r,a,T}=(r+T\|a\|_\infty)\exp(T\|a\|_\infty)$.
%	Let $R>0$ be sufficiently large such that $\supp(\mu_0)\subseteq B(0,R)$.
% The choice $r = R$ in Proposition \ref{le:uniquecara},  Lemma \ref{p-Floclip}, and  Lemma \ref{p-Fmuloclip}  imply the following stability estimate
%	\begin{align}\label{eq:liptrans}
%		\bigl|\ct^\mu_t(x_0)-\ct^\mu_t(x_1)\bigr|
%			\leq e^{T\,\Lip_{B(0,R)}(\Fun{a})}|x_0-x_1|,\quad \text{ for } |x_i|\leq R\,,\quad i=0,1\,.
%	\end{align}
%	i.e., $\ct^\mu_t$ is locally Lipschitz.
%	
%	In view of the uniqueness of the solutions to the ODE \eqref{eq:transpdyn}, it is also clear that, for any $t_0\in [0,T]$, the inverse of $\ct^\mu_{t_0}$ is
%	given by the transport map associated to the backward-in-time ODE
%\begin{align*}
%\left\{\begin{aligned}
%\dot{\xi}(t) &= (\Fun{a}*\mu(t))(\xi(t)) \quad \text{ for } t \in [0,t_0),\\
%\xi(t_0) &= \xi_0.
%\end{aligned}\right.
%\end{align*}
%%\dot \(t)=\bigl(\Fun{a}\ast\mu\bigr)(x)\,,\quad x(t_0)=x_0\,.
%	However, this problem in turn can be cast into the form of an usual IVP simply by considering the reverse trajectory $\nu_t=\mu_{t_0-t}$. Then
%	$y(t)=\xi(t_0-t)$ solves
%	\begin{align*}
%	\left\{\begin{aligned}
%		\dot y(t)&=-\bigl(\Fun{a}\ast\nu(t)\bigr)(y(t))  \quad \text{ for } t \in (0,t_0], \\
%		y(0) &= \xi(t_0).
%	\end{aligned}\right.
%	\end{align*}
%	The corresponding stability estimate for this problem then yields that the inverse of $\ct^\mu_t$ exists and is locally Lipschitz (with the same local Lipschitz constant as $\ct^\mu_t$).
%\end{proof}



One has also uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial data for \eqref{eq:contdyn}: %(we report a proof of these properties in Appendix \ref{ap3} for completeness):

\begin{theorem}\cite{CanCarRos10}\label{uniq}
Fix $T>0$  and let $\mu:[0,T]\rightarrow\mathcal{P}_1(\R^d)$ and $\nu:[0,T]\rightarrow\mathcal{P}_1(\R^d)$ be two equi-compactly supported solutions  of \eqref{eq:contdyn}, for $\mu(0)=\mu_0$ and $\nu(0)=\nu_0$ respectively. Let $R>0$ be such that for every $t \in[0, T]$
\begin{align}\label{supptot}
\supp(\mu(t))\cup\supp(\nu(t)) \subseteq B(0, R)\,.
\end{align}
Then, there exist a positive constant $\overline{C}$ depending only on $T$, $a$,  and $R$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{stab}
\W_1(\mu(t), \nu(t)) \le \overline{C} \, \W_1(\mu_0, \nu_0)
\end{equation}
for every $t \in [0, T]$. In particular, equi-compactly supported solutions of \eqref{eq:contdyn} are uniquely determined by the initial datum.
\end{theorem}
